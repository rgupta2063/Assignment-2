    <h2 class="head">Company Overview</h2>
    <p>With innovative approaches and advanced methodologies, Vecta Corp. provides scalable
         business solutions to help companies achieve success<br> through revenue increase, 
         cost management and user satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>Our approach stems from the three most important business growth aspects: 
        helping companies reach prospects, assist in converting prospects to<br> customers, 
        and assist in retaining those customers. This is accomplished through our 
        interactive solutions and expertise in providing a memorable and<br> positive user experience.
    </p>
    <p>In order to effectively prospect, convert and retain, 
        the user experience is placed at the center of all our development projects. 
        Providing unique,<br> memorable and positive experiences, striking the appropriate 
        emotional connection and reducing mental effort required to interact with the site<br> 
        ultimately results in higher prospect conversion and customer retention figures.
    </p>
    <p>Our expertise in strategy, design and technology allows us to create business
        solutions that excite and inspire, are easy to navigate, and enable<br> businesses to
        strengthen their competitive advantage. 
    </p>
    <p>With increased conversion and retention, our solutions provide companies with
       opportunities to increase revenues and enhance productivity. This is<br> how we helped 
       Dorknozzle achieve remarkable success, including more than doubling their customer 
       base from 20,000 to 70,000 within 15 months<br> of launching a Vecta Corp. solution.
